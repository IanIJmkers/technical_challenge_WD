#The Phone Cav
At The Phone Cave, we present you with a challenge to create an application that allows users to browse through our catalog of phones available at our store. This app enables users to view a list of all phones, select a specific phone to see its details, and view images of each device. The app communicates with a REST API server to fetch the necessary data.

Technologies Used
Node.js: Used to create the REST API server.
React: Used to build the frontend of the application.
Axios: Utilized for making HTTP requests to the REST API.
React Bootstrap: Styling the components to ensure an attractive user interface.

Features
View Phones: Browse through a list of all phones available at The Phone Cave store.
Phone Details: Select a phone from the list to view detailed information about the selected phone model.
Loading Indicator: A spinner component is displayed while waiting for the API response, ensuring a smooth user experience.
